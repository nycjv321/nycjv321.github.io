I'm Javier Luis Velasquez. I'm a software practioner. 

Ask me about DevOps and the Testing Pyramid.

When I'm not talking about testing and devops with developers, I'm busy propogating succulents or reading.


I started my professional career in 2011. I've functioned many roles in technology for almost a decade. I've been called Test Automation Engineer, Developer, and an SDET.
