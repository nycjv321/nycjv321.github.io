I'm Javier Luis Velasquez. I'm a software practioner. 

Ask me about DevOps and the Testing Pyramid.

When I'm not talking about testing and devops with developers, I'm busy propogating succulents or reading. When I'm not at home doing these things, I'm out jogging or being outdoors and enjoying nature. 


I started my professional career in 2011. I've functioned in many roles. I've been called a Test Automation Engineer, a Developer/Engineer, and an SDET.
