I'm Javier Luis Velasquez. I'm a software practioner. 

Ask me about DevOps and the Testing Pyramid.

When I'm not talking about testing and devops with colleagues, I'm reading and enjoying the precense of my succulents. When I'm not at home doing these things, I'm out jogging or being outdoors and enjoying nature.  And when I'm not doing those things I'm ðŸŽ®ing on my Switch or PC.


I started my professional career in 2011. I've functioned in many roles. I've been called a Quality Engineer, a Test Automation Engineer, a Developer/Engineer, and an SDET.
